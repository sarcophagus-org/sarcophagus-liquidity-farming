Sarcophagus is a decentralized dead man's switch built on Ethereum and Arweave.

## Overview
This repository contains the smart contracts and frontend code necessary for the operation of [SARCO Token Liquidity Farming](https://farming.sarcophagus.io). Liquidity Farming is the process of locking SARCO-ETH LP Tokens into a contract for a period of time, therefore requiring users to add liquidity to the SARCO-ETH Uniswap Pair in exchange for a proportional emission of SARCO tokens.

The SARCO liquidity farming contract is live on mainnet at [`0x0`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0).

## Frontend
The frontend is a React app which reads and writes directly from and to the on-chain contract.
